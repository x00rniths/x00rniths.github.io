    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>We are a group of four high school students who like to watch orniths and do capture the flag events.</p><br>
    <p>Currently, all members of the Orniths are juniors at High Technology High School, although the team is not affiliated with the school. In no particular order, the team consists of:</p><br>
    <p>Steven Liu</p>
    <p>Sam Alws</p>
    <p>Adrian Thamburaj</p>
    <p>Eric Zheng</p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h1>Where does the name come from?</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>This name is shrouded in myth, and there are many possible origins. Some say that it is named after the great masterpiece of the famed Athenian playwright Aristophanes. Some say that it is a call for conservation. Still others insist that it is taken from a long line of High Tech tradition. The most likely explanation is that a group of teenagers were at loss for a good name.</p>
